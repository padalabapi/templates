India is the largest producer of films in the world and second oldest film industry in the world.[32] The country is home of the one of the most important cities in the global film industry, Mumbai (previously called Bombay). In 2009 India produced a total of 2,961 films on celluloid; this figure includes 1,288 feature films.[33] Besides being the largest producer of films in the world, India also has the largest number of admissions.[34] Indian film industry is multi-lingual and the largest in the world in terms of ticket sales but 3rd largest in terms of revenue mainly due to having among the lowest ticket prices in the world.[35] The industry is viewed mainly by a vast film-going Indian public, and Indian films have been[when?] gaining increasing popularity in the rest of the world—notably in countries with large numbers of expatriate Indians.[citation needed] Indian film industry is also the dominant source of films and entertainment in its neighboring countries of South Asia. The largest film and most popular industry in India is the Hindi film industry, followed by Telugu cinema and Tamil cinema. The Hindi film industry mostly concentrated in Mumbai (Bombay), and is commonly referred to as Bollywood, a portmanteau of Bombay and Hollywood. Sandalwood industry is (Kannada cinema) concentrated in Bengaluru. The Mollywood industry concentrated in the state of Kerala refers to the Malayalam cinema. Tollywood (Telugu cinema)and Kollywood (Tamil cinema) are concentrated in Hyderabad and Chennai respectively. By 2021, Telugu cinema (Tollywood) has overtaken Hindi cinema (Bollywood) and emerged as the largest film industry in India in terms of box-office.[36][37]

Besides the mainstream commercial movies, India also offers a different approach to cinema- the parallel cinema.The parallel cinema movement originated in West Bengal around the 1950s. Parallel cinema is a blanket term designated to a certain type of films that stray away from the conventions of popular mainstream cinema.Parallel cinema has assumed various forms throughout the years. Filmmakers associated with parallel cinema are Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak. Parallel films are characterized by their rejection of popular forms like the songs and fight sequences, their affinity for rural settings, use of method actors and toned down colour palettes. Some examples of such movies are Raincoat, Dhobi Ghat, Mithya.

Indian films have garnered popularity not only in the domestic market but also in the international markets with Dangal having an overseas gross revenue of $260 million, Secret Superstar, and Bajrangi Bhaijaan with a gross revenue of $80.4 million, and Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion a recent blockbuster from the Telugu industry known as Tollywood.[38]
